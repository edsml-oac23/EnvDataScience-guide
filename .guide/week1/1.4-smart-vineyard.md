# 1.4 Smart Vineyard Project

In this mini-project you will combine climate time series with vineyard boundaries to explore environmental impacts on viticulture.

### Objectives
- Query climate data (temperature/precipitation) via STAC
- Extract vineyard polygons from satellite imagery using foundation models (SAM via samgeo)
- Zonal statistics: compute climate trends inside vineyard areas
- Visualize results interactively with leafmap

### Data
- Sentinel-2 imagery (via STAC)
- ERA5 climate reanalysis (temperature, precipitation)

### Steps
1. Search and load Sentinel-2 scene over a vineyard region
2. Use samgeo to automatically segment vineyard parcels (zero-shot)
3. Load ERA5 climate data with xarray
4. Compute zonal statistics (mean temperature/precipitation per vineyard)
5. Plot time series and interactive map
