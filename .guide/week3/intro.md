# Week 3: Remote Sensing & GeoAI

This week introduces modern geospatial techniques for Earth Observation.

Topics:
- Foundation models (SAM, CLIP, vision transformers)
- Zero-shot and custom segmentation
- Change detection pipelines

The pre-installed stack includes `segment-geospatial` (samgeo) and `geoai-py` for advanced training.

Begin with 3.1 to explore foundation models.
