# 1.1 Preparing your environment

Welcome to the **Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning** module.

In this course we work with a wide variety of data typical of environmental research:

- **Vector data** (shapefiles, GeoJSON, etc.)
- **Raster data** (satellite imagery, drone orthomosaics, digital elevation models)
- **Time series** (climate reanalysis, sensor networks)
- **Text, images, and videos** for modern GeoAI tasks

### Why do we use a Dev Container?

You may have noticed that the first time you open the repository in VS Code it takes several minutes.  
This is not a simple folder — you are **building a professional geospatial data science lab** inside your computer.

#### The classic problem: “It works on my machine”
In previous years students spent the first 1–2 practical sessions only trying to install dependencies:

- Student A (macOS) → wrong Python version or Apple Silicon issues
- Student B (Windows) → GDAL/PROJ/Fiona binary conflicts
- Student C (Linux) → missing system libraries

These problems are extremely common when installing geospatial Python packages individually.

#### The solution: the Dev Container
We use a **Docker container** that contains everything pre-configured:

- Over **700 compatible libraries** are installed in one go using the `geospatial` meta-package (maintained by the opengeos community).
- **Mamba** (a faster solver than conda) resolves the complex dependency puzzle behind the scenes.
- The result is an identical, reproducible environment on **macOS, Windows, and Linux**.

The initial build is a one-time cost. After the first successful build:
- Subsequent opens are **instant** (the container is cached).
- If anything goes wrong, simply choose **“Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container”** from the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).

### Why the `geospatial` meta-package?

Geospatial Python libraries are notoriously difficult to install because of binary dependencies (GDAL, PROJ, GEOS, etc.).  
The `geospatial` package from conda-forge bundles **hundreds of carefully tested, compatible versions** of the most common tools:

- `geopandas`, `rasterio`, `fiona`, `shapely`, `pyproj`
- `xarray`, `rioxarray`, `dask-geopandas`
- `leafmap` for interactive mapping
- `segment-geospatial` (samgeo) for foundation-model segmentation
- and many more

This avoids the usual version conflicts that have frustrated environmental data scientists for years.

You are of course free to create your own environment recipe — this one is simply the result of years of experience resolving the most common issues.

### Verify your environment

Look at the integrated terminal — you should see something like:
